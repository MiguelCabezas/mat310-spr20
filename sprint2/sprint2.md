# Sprint 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata and Regular Languages

# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Feb. 12 - Feb. 26
* Quiz date/time: Feb. 26 at the start of class
* Requirements due: Feb. 24 at the end of class 

# Rationale: 
In Sprint 2, we will continue our exploration of regular languages.  Now that we've constructed **deterministic** finite automata, we'll move on to **nondeterministic** finite automata.  Nondeterminisim means that we can have more than one outcome even when the input is fixed.  At first pass, there seems to be no relation between DFA and NDFA, but as we will see, they are equivalent!  We'll see what makes a finite state machine diagram nondeterministric and then learn how to convert NDFAs to DFAs and see that they are equivalent.  We'll see that NDFAs can actually be more concise and simple compared to DFAS.  Moreover, they can be combined easily to make even more complex machines using union, concatenation, and Kleene star operations very easily!

## Team Requirements:
   * Track tasks and generate a burndown chart
       * You can use technologies other than Trello in this sprint, but you must have some common list of tasks which you can track (and I can view) and a representation of the burndown chart
       * The problem set
   
# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the [Expert Request](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jNfbBpN1clDJfn?course=mat310s20&sprint=2) for more resources.

# Reality Check:
  * On Wednesday, after the Sprint 1 quiz, do the Sprint 1 retrospective.  Do sprint planning meeting (generate sprint backlog and time estimations).  Skim the problem set.
  * TODO by next class:  .
  * Monday class: 
  * TODO by next class: 
  * Wednesday: 
  * TODO by next class: 
  * Monday: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class.
  * TODO before next class: Play review game if you haven't alreay. Take the practice quiz and check your answers.  Study as a group.  
  * Wednesday: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint 2 retrospective, and Sprint 3 planning.

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this [sprint retrospective survey](https://rollins.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAIzhpHFYbIixf?course=mat310s20&sprint=2).  Each team member should complete a survey.
